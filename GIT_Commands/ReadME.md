METHOD 1 :

1.Create a New Repo on github profile dashboard after github login.

2.Use the commands written on github start page on VS code terminal after creating a new file (text , pdf , word , html ,etc) in a new folder on Desktop.

Index.html (example code):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Welcome to Firebase Auth Demo API!</h1>
<p>You are successfully authenticated with Firebase and Node.js.</p>
</body>
</html>

METHOD 2 :

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create a GitHub account, create a repository, and push your code using Git commands:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1.Go to https://github.com

2.Click Sign up.

3.Fill in your username, email, and password.

4.Verify your email and complete account setup.


Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.After logging in, click the + icon at the top-right and select "New repository".

2.Give your repo a name (e.g., my-first-repo).

3.Choose:
o
Public or Private
o
(Optional) Add a README file.

4.Click Create repository.

Step 3: Set Up Git Locally
Make sure Git is installed. Run this to check:
git --version
If not installed, download it from https://git-scm.com.

Step 4: Initialize Your Local Repository
In your project folder:
cd path/to/your/project
git init

Step 5: Add Files and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 6: Link Your Local Repo to GitHub
Copy the remote URL from your GitHub repo (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/my-first-repo.git) and run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-first-repo.git

Step 7: Push to GitHub
If this is your first push:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

IF ERRORS FOLLOW THE BELOW COMMANDS OR STEPS : -

If you're trying to push to GitHub but not pushing due to a branch error, it usually means either:
â€¢
Your local branch name doesn't match the remote branch (e.g., trying to push main when it doesn't exist remotely).
â€¢
You're trying to push from a branch that doesn't track any remote branch yet.
Fix Branch Errors with These Commands

ðŸ›  1. Check your current branch name
git branch
Make sure you're on the correct branch, typically main or master.

ðŸ›  2. Rename your local branch to main (if needed)
If you're on master and GitHub is expecting main, rename it:
git branch -m master main

ðŸ›  3. Set the upstream branch and push
This tells Git where to push your local branch:
git push -u origin main
The -u flag sets the upstream branch so future git push or git pull commands will work without extra arguments.

ðŸ›  4. If remote already has a branch with a different name
You can create and push a branch that matches your local branch:
git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name

ðŸ›  5. To list remote branches (for troubleshooting)
git branch -r



Example :


C:\Users\eXpert\Desktop\WAD>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/eXpert/Desktop/WAD/.git/

C:\Users\eXpert\Desktop\WAD>git remote add origin https://github.com/HarshCraft/WAD_Practical.git
WAD Cheat no.3

3.Create a version control account on GitHub and use Git commands to create a repository and push your code to GitHub.

C:\Users\eXpert\Desktop\WAD>git add .

C:\Users\eXpert\Desktop\WAD>git commit -m "Initial commit for WAD practical"
